# Powershell script to deploy a .Net website
## The script includes the following steps:
- Create a user and group, and grant the appropriate permissions to the application pool identity.
- Create an application pool that runs under the created user.
- Create a website, import the certificate from a PFX file into the machine certificate store (Cert:\LocalMachine\My), and bind the certificate to the website.
- Set the log file path for the website.
- Publish the "hello" application to the specified physical path inside the website directory.
- Create the application under the website and associate it with the application pool.

## Example of running
    ```
        .\deploy-website.ps1 -Password "eurofins" -PfxPassword "eurofins" -BindingHost "localhosttest"
    ```

*Note*: above running is for self-signed certificate. In case of using public certificate, we need to specify the path of PFX file through "-PfxPath <cert_path>" and disable self signed certificate "-SelfSignedCertificate False".
