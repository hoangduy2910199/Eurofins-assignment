| Deploy Application      | Access to the host and run Powershell deployment script.  | Not implement |
| Deploy monitoring method| Access to the host and run Windows service deployment script. | Not implement |


## Example of running

1. Update code in app folder.

    ![alt text](./assets/image-.png)

2. Pipeline is triggered. By default, the output will be an application artifact and pushed to Github registry.

    ![alt text](./assets/image-1-.png)

3. Application Artifact is published

    ![alt text](./assets/image-2-.png)

4. Code security scan report

5. If we would like to build a docker image, we'll trigger the workflow with *Image* publish-type option.

# Powershell script to deploy a .Net website
## The script includes the following steps:
- Create a user and group, and grant the appropriate permissions to the application pool identity.
- Create an application pool that runs under the created user.
- Create a website, import the certificate from a PFX file into the machine certificate store (Cert:\LocalMachine\My), and bind the certificate to the website.
- Set the log file path for the website.
- Publish the "hello" application to the specified physical path inside the website directory.
- Create the application under the website and associate it with the application pool.

## Example of running
    
        .\deploy-website.ps1 -Password "eurofins" -PfxPassword "eurofins" -BindingHost "localhosttest"

*Note*: above running is for self-signed certificate. In case of using public certificate, we need to specify the path of PFX file through "-PfxPath <cert_path>" and disable self signed certificate "-SelfSignedCertificate False".

# Powershell script to deploy monitoring service
## The script do the following steps:
- Create a User, grant permission on the service executable folder and the service log on right.
- Publish .Net service to a target folder.
- Create and start the service with the created user.

## Example of running
    
        .\deploy-hello-monitor-service.ps1 -CodePath "C:\Learning\Eurofins-assignment\services\HelloWorldMonitorService\" -Password "eurofins" -PublishFolder "C:\myService"
    

- Run script to deploy monitoring service.

    ![alt text](./assets/image-8.png)

- The service is running with specified user.

    ![alt text](./assets/image-9.png)

- The service is auto-start and recover after 300 second if failed.

    ![alt text](./assets/image-11.png)

- Log is written into status.txt file.

    ![alt text](./assets/image-10.png)

- When stop the IIS web app.

- Service stopped due to status != 200 OK

    ![alt text](./assets/image-14.png)

- Service auto-recover after 5 minutes.
